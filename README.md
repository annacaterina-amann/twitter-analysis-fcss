# Social Media Polarization within Tweets on the hashtags “letztegeneration”, “lastgeneration” and “klimakleber”
This repository contains a Python script that retrieves data and objects from Twitter and generates a CSV file. There is also a jupyter notebook to perform data analysis on the retreived data.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Running the script
To run the script, simply execute the tweet_scraping.py file from the command line:
```python
python tweet_scraping.py
```
The script will retrieve the data from the specified URL and generate a CSV file.

## Customizing the Script
The script can be easily customized to retrieve different types of data or to generate different types of output. You can modify the query variable to retrieve data from a different hashtag. You can also modify the retrieved Twitter objects as needed.
